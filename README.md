# 108 Group Project 1

## Premise
> You are part of Imaginary AB and have been working on a worthy successor to Small Theft Auto: Södermalm up until now. While the release is still pending, your company has chosen to re-allocate some of the resources of multiple teams (including you) to begin prototyping the Company’s next title before the New Year in order to satisfy stakeholder demand before the annual general meeting in January.
> 
> Your company is part of a larger network of companies and the board has agreed on the recent success of Yac AB’s Role-Playing Game Boarhammer 42 meaning that there is currently a market gap for RPGs. Your team has therefore been selected to begin work on a polished Vertical Slice to serve as a Proof-of-Concept for a larger endeavor.
> 
> Thanks to a common management, your team has been provided access to the company network’s asset database including assets from Boarhammer 42.
> 
> The Genre has been narrowed down to an ARPG and the expected set of features has been collected by a board of designers.
